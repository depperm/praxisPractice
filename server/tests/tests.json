        "question": "Which of the following is an accurate statement about what IDEA requires for any IEP?",
        "answers": ["The IEP must include a multiyear outline of instructional objectives.","The IEP must include a section on assistive devices, regardless of the nature or degree of the student's disability.","The IEP must be in effect before special education services or related services are provided.","The IEP must not be made available to any school personnel except special education teachers"],
        "correct_answer": 2,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {2}. According to IDEA, an IEP must be in effect before special education and related services are provided to an eligible student. None of the other choices is required. The objectives in an IEP are ordinarily for a single year, so {0} is not correct. {1} is not correct because what IDEA requires is that an IEP include a statement of the services and aids to be provided to the child. For some students with disabilities, this will include assistive devices, but many students with disabilities do not require such devices. Although special education teachers certainly have access to their students' IEPs, IDEA requires that regular education teachers and other service providers who are responsible for implementing a student's IEP have access to it as well, so {3} is not correct.",

        "correct_answer": 1,
        "selectedAnswer": -1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {1}. A visual reminder can increase appropriate behavior. {0} is not correct because a peer buddy should not be given the task of keeping another student on task. {2} is not correct because that is not an appropriate strategy for Trish. {3} is not correct because that strategy is not related to the behavior."

        "correct_answer": 1,
        "selectedAnswer": -1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {1}. One component of successful transfer of learning is the similarity between the situation on which a skill is learned and the situation to which it is to be applied. {0}, {2}, and {3} are not correct because they are activities that would most likely not promote word attack skills."

        "selectedAnswer": -1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {1}. According to IDEA, the IFSP must include plans for making the transition from early intervention services into preschool. {0} is not correct because IFSPs do not include budgets. {2} and {3} are not correct because they are optional and are not likely to be documented in an IFSP."

        "explanation": "The correct answer is {3}. Functional language training involves giving children a means of influencing and interacting with the environment. {0}, {1}, and {2} are not correct because teaching children to make sounds or imitate words in isolation does not fulfill the goal of functional language training."

        "correct_answer": 3,
        "selectedAnswer": -1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {3}. Learning mastery generally refers to those lessons taught in the classroom. A teacher-developed test is more likely than a standardized achievement test to assess students' mastery of those lessons and is therefore more likely to have better content validity. {0} is not correct because all tests should be intended to yield true scores. {1} is not correct because interrater reliability is determined by the degree of agreement among raters. {2} is not correct because that is more characteristic of a normreferenced assessment."

        "correct_answer": 0,
        "selectedAnswer": -1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {0}. In inclusion settings, an appropriate role for the special education teacher is as a co-teacher with the general education teacher. Although the special education teacher may have primary responsibility for behavior management with certain special education students, the teachers should share responsibility for both behavior management and academic content. The special education teacher should not be the assistant to the general education teacher, so {1} is not correct. While the special education teacher may observe the general education teacher and offer recommendations on working with classified students, this is done in the role of collaborating professional, not in the role of evaluator, so {2} is not correct. {3} is not correct because, although the special education teacher may have primary responsibility for behavior management with certain special education students, the teachers should share responsibility for both behavior management and academic content."

        "question": "Which of the following statements best defines the ecological perspective on emotional and behavioral disorders?",
        "answers": ["Poisons in the physical environment cause emotional and behavioral disorders.","Emotional and behavioral disorders involve interactions between the child and the child's social environment.","Children with emotional and behavioral disorders need exposure to an everbroadening social environment.","Inclusion settings are less beneficial for students with emotional and behavioral disorders than for students with other types of disabilities."],
        "correct_answer": 1,
        "selectedAnswer": -1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {1}. The ecological perspective emphasizes the importance of interactions between the child and the child's environment in emotional and behavioral disorders. {0} is not correct; the ecological perspective on emotional and behavioral disorders does not refer to the influence of toxins in the physical environment. Neither {2} nor {3} defines this perspective."

        "correct_answer": 0,
        "selectedAnswer": -1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {0}. All student work reflects the curriculum; thus, the assessment is curriculumbased. {1} is incorrect because standardized tests compare students' data with those of other students in the same age-group. {2} is incorrect because summative assessments are used to determine whether the student is meeting the curriculum requirements; it is not used to guide instruction. {3} is incorrect because guided practice is a teaching strategy used to provide instruction, not evaluate progress."

        "question": "Which of the following is the best rationale for using task analysis in instructing students with disabilities?",
        "answers": ["Instruction is delivered in steps that are easily achievable and that promote student success.","Students can eventually learn to analyze assigned tasks themselves.","Students learn classification skills by identifying similar aspects of different kinds of tasks.","Instruction can be delivered effectively to many students at once without need for individualization."],
        "correct_answer": 0,
        "selectedAnswer": -1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {0}. Instruction that is provided in steps that are easily achievable and that promote student success are two key justifications for the use of task analysis. {1} is incorrect because, although the skill it describes is a possible benefit of using task analysis, it is not the basic rationale for the use of task analysis. {2} is not correct because the learning of classification skills is not a primary objective of task analysis. {3} is not correct because individualization of instruction is always important in instructing students with disabilities."

        "correct_answer": 3,
        "selectedAnswer": -1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {3}. Mary's achievement score indicates high mathematical ability; 9 is the highest possible stanine score. Based on the information presented, the most appropriate placement is the advanced class. {0}, {1}, and {2} are not appropriate based on her high mathematical ability. Despite her learning disabilities, it is entirely possible that she could, perhaps with support, undertake an advanced class in an area of strength."

        "question": "Jodeen is a 7-year-old who has been evaluated and found to have a mild expressive language delay. Her hearing is normal, and her functioning in all areas other than expressive language is age appropriate. Which of the following placements would be most appropriate for Jodeen?",
        "answers": ["A self-contained special education class with speech and language services","A part-time placement in a resource room for developmental and oral reading","A full-time general education placement with speech and language services","A full-time general education placement with an emphasis on reading support"],
        "correct_answer": 2,
        "selectedAnswer": -1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {2}. Since Jodeen's functioning is age appropriate in most respects, it is probable that she could work at the level of the class in a general education setting if she were provided with appropriate support services to address her expressive language deficit. There is no clear justification for a full-time special education setting, as in {0}, as the initial placement for a young child with a very specific expressive language delay and no other disability. There is no evidence that Jodeen needs support for reading, so {1} and {3} are not correct."

        "correct_answer": 2,
        "selectedAnswer": -1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {2}. Once a skill has been mastered, the teacher can best assure its retention by providing additional meaningful learning situations in which the student can recall and use the skill. {0}, {1}, and {2} are not correct because they would not assist learners in retaining previously acquired skills."

        "correct_answer": 0,
        "selectedAnswer": -1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {0}. There are several possible causes of Down syndrome, with the most common being trisomy 21, the failure of one pair of parental chromosomes to separate at conception. {1} is not correct because PKU is caused by a defect in the gene that helps create the enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine. {2} is not correct because Klinefelter syndrome occurs when a boy is born with one or more extra X chromosomes. {3} is not correct because Turner syndrome is a chromosomal condition that alters development in females."

        "correct_answer": 0,
        "selectedAnswer": -1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {0}. Remedial instruction is one-on-one or small-group instruction that focuses on the needs of the individual student. {0}, {1}, and {2}, are not characteristic of the type of instruction that is being provided."

        "correct_answer": 1,
        "selectedAnswer": -1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {1}. Research has indicated that children with autism spectrum disorder prefer routines and structure in daily academic life. Using the visual schedule will help Beth anticipate the routine and become more accustomed to the new environment. {0} is not correct because reducing a child's school attendance to a half-day would not help her adjust to the new environment. {2} is not correct because taking Beth on a tour of the school would be useful but it is not a long-term support like a visual schedule. {3} is not correct because providing time away would not help Beth adjust to her school. Instead, this would limit interactions with peers and teachers, which would inhibit the adjustment process."

        "correct_answer": 0,
        "selectedAnswer": -1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {0}. Written consent by a parent or guardian is required to refer a student for a formal evaluation to determine whether special education services are appropriate. {1} is incorrect because the consent must be written, not verbal. {2} is incorrect because although school personnel can initiate a referral, written consent must be given by a parent/guardian to follow through with the screening. {3} is incorrect because a physician's input can be valuable; however, it does not initiate the referral process or provide consent for screening."

        "correct_answer": 0,
        "selectedAnswer": -1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {0}. Early childhood is a time to learn respectful communication and social skills through play and structured activities. {1} is incorrect because good manners and etiquette vary by culture and are best taught in informal home situations. {2} is incorrect because prekindergarten students need free play, which should not be restricted due to common conflicts. {3} is incorrect because teacher intervention is not always needed when conflicts arise; children should be encouraged and supported in solving basic conflicts."

        "explanation": "The correct answer is {2}. Students with learning disabilities are likely to lag behind other children in their ability to identify and focus on the key aspects of a task while disregarding the less important aspects of that task. {0} is incorrect because it has not been proven that students with learning disabilities are more likely than other students to have either left-brain or right-brain dominance for learning. {1} is incorrect because students with learning disabilities do not necessarily have difficulty with long-term memory retrieval. {3} is incorrect because there is no clear evidence to suggest that students with learning disabilities are more gifted than others in artistic expression."

        "explanation": "The correct answer is {1}. Many children with emotional and behavioral disorders act impulsively, have short attention spans, and often exhibit anxiety, thus allowing the co-occurring classification of ADHD. {0}, {2}, and {3} are incorrect because although they may be comorbid with an EBD, none of them are the most commonly co-occurring disability."

        "explanation": "The correct answer is {0}. Summative assessments are given to test student learning relative to the curriculum, and a chapter test assesses knowledge of the entire chapter. {1} is incorrect because writing sentences using spelling words is an example of an instructional activity, not a summative assessment. {2} is incorrect because homework is used as a follow-up to classroom instruction. {3} is incorrect because practicing a skill is part of instruction, not assessment."

        "explanation": "The correct answer is {3}. Executive function includes planning, organizing, keeping track of time, keeping track of multiple things, relating earlier learning to current learning, and other higher cognitive activities. {0} is incorrect because sequencing involves arranging items in the correct order (chronological, logical, etc.), and is also one specific aspect of executive function. {1} is incorrect because self-regulation relates only to talking out of turn in class, and is just one component of executive function. {2} is incorrect because memory, or retaining and retrieving information, requires using mental strategies that are included in executive function."

Voiced stop sounds are not as easy to pronounce in isolation without a vowel sound. {0} is not correct. Introducing letter sounds in alphabetical order limits the number of words the students can form, thus limiting their ability to practice using the alphabetic principle to read and write. Research generally agrees that the earliest relationships introduced should be those that enable children to begin reading words as soon as possible. That is, the relationships chosen should have high utility.

To answer this question, the student can infer from the first paragraph that because an Earth year is \"the amount of time it takes for Earth to orbit once around the Sun\" and a Mars year is \"how long it takes Mars to orbit the Sun,\" a Saturn year must also be the amount of time it takes for Saturn to orbit once around the Sun. The second sentence of the third paragraph (\"A year on another planet depends on how long it takes that planet to orbit\") further reinforces this inference. The student can then integrate this idea with the information from the third table column, \"Time the planet takes to make orbit,\" to see that Saturn takes 10,756 Earth days to orbit, which is clearly longer than Earth's year of 365 days, a length of time mentioned in both the text and the table. {0} is incorrect because this question is explicitly answered in the table only, under \"Distance from the Sun.\" {2} is incorrect because this question is answered in the text only, both in the first paragraph and in the third paragraph, in the statement \"A year on another planet depends on how long it takes that planet to orbit.\" {3} is incorrect because to answer the question, the student can rely on the text and on the background knowledge that a typical fifth grader is ten or eleven years old, since the second paragraph says, \"A typical fifth grader would be only six Mars years old because a Mars year is almost twice as long as an Earth year.\""

        "explanation": "The correct answer is {2}. The student's statement indicates a confusion between the concepts of physical age and planetary years. The student does not understand that if he lived on a planet farther from the Sun than Earth is, he would have fewer birthdays because an orbit takes longer, therefore making an actual year longer. He would not actually be a \"baby\" or younger physically than if he were on Earth. {0} and {1} are not misconceptions. Age is actually calculated differently on each planet {0}, and planets that are farther from the Sun do actually have longer years {1}. {3} is incorrect because while the Sun does cause the skin to \"age,\" in the sense that it damages the skin, this kind of aging is different from physical growth, which is the focus of the student's misconception. Keeping a baby's skin farther from the Sun might cause him to avoid getting skin damage, but it would not prevent him from growing into an elementary-aged child."

        "explanation": "The correct answer is 8812. Josh's error is that he is not regrouping when necessary; instead, he is just writing the sum of the digits in each place value column. His written answer is correct in the third problem because 11 hundreds (the result of adding 3 hundreds and 8 hundreds) is equivalent to regrouping to get 1100. However, when he does not regroup in the first two problems, his written answers are incorrect. For example, in the first problem, Josh adds 8 tens and 6 tens to get 14 tens, but instead of regrouping 10 of those tens to get 100 and then writing the final answer as 847, Josh just adds the 3 hundreds and the 4 hundreds and then writes the final answer as 7147. Therefore, if Josh uses the same method in the last problem, he will add 8 and 4 to get 12 ones, but he will not regroup, and then he will add 2 and 6 to get 8 and 3 and 5 to get 8, and his final answer will be 8812."

In the first solution, 4x and 2 are added to get 6x , but the 4x term contains a variable, whereas the 2 is a constant term; it is incorrect to add 4x and 2 because they are not like terms. Similarly, in the second solution, 2x and 3 are added to get 5x , but 2x and 3 are not like terms, so this strategy is not valid.

In {4}, the number 28 is decomposed as the difference of 3 tens, written as the sum of 2 tens and 1 ten, and 2 ones. {0} is incorrect because the number 28 is decomposed as a repeated addition of the number 7, so this decomposition is related to skip counting. {2} is incorrect because the number 28 is decomposed as the sum of 14 and itself, so this decomposition is related to doubles. {5} and {6} are incorrect because although both answers are decompositions of 28, neither of the numbers in either decomposition is a multiple of 10."

        "correct_answer":[0,2],
        "explanation": "The correct answers are {0} and {2}. This question tests your understanding of how to guide students toward correcting misconceptions. In the activity described, a student has incorrectly concluded that the longest of four shadows was created at midday, when the Sun was high in the sky. By responding to the question posed in {0}, the student will have an opportunity to realize that the shadows cast by the student always pointed away from the Sun’s position in the sky, and that the longest of the four shadows pointed to the northeast. By responding to the question posed in {2}, the student will have an opportunity to realize that the longest shadows observed in the activity were cast when the Sun was low in the sky. Responding to the questions posed in the other choices will not help the student understand how the Sun’s position in the sky affects shadow length. The question posed in {1} is more appropriate for clarifying that the height of the student casting the shadows did not change during the activity. The question posed in {3} is more appropriate for understanding how the Sun’s position in the sky changes with the seasons. The question posed in {4} is more appropriate for identifying a potential source of error in the investigation."

In the activity described, students are designing experiments to investigate how different factors affect the attraction between two bar magnets. By investigating the scientific question posed in {0}, the students will test whether they introduced an uncontrolled variable into their initial experiment by using different objects (index cards and a box of crayons) to separate the two bar magnets. By investigating the scientific question posed in {3}, the students will test whether changing the distance between the two bar magnets will affect the strength of the magnetic attraction even when no objects are placed between the magnets. Investigating the questions posed in the other choices will not help the students interpret their results. The scientific question posed in {1} is not relevant to the investigation because it focuses on the differences between bar magnets and horseshoe magnets. Investigating the scientific question posed in {2} will not generate new information because the students already know that the four teams obtained similar results, indicating that human error was not a contributing factor.

        "answers": ["Allowing Beth to attend school for a half-day for the first month","Providing Beth with a visual schedule of daily activities","Taking Beth on a tour of the school so that she can become familiar with the layout of the classrooms","Providing Beth with time away from her classmates when she has an outburst"],
        "correct_answer":1,
        "explanation": "The correct answer is {1}. Research has indicated that children with autism spectrum disorder prefer routines and structure in daily academic life. Using the visual schedule would help Beth anticipate the routine and become more accustomed to the new environment. {0} is incorrect because reducing a child's school attendance to a half-day would not help her adjust to the new environment. {2} is not correct because taking Beth on a tour of the school would be useful but it is not a long-term support like a visual schedule. {3} is not correct because providing time away would not help Beth adjust to her school. Instead, this would limit interactions with peers and teachers, which would inhibit the adjustment process."
